## About the Project

The PulseSpotter project aims to assist journalists in the task of identifying newsworthy topics - topics that are likely to become popular, hence deserving attention from the journalist point of view. The system will collect the topics from various sources over time, analyse the patterns and make suggestions on which topics are emerging as popular.

The objective is to help journalists by saving time otherwise spent on news gathering, topic identification and also investigation on whether a particular topic is newsworthy enough.
